## Introduction

Nabbar Nav is a React component for navigation bars, made to fit into existing projects with relative ease.

The inspiration for Nabbar came out of my interest in [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). Until learning grid, I had relied on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for most of my layout needs. The power of CSS Grid made me think I could do without Bootstrap, and so far that has been the case. One aspect of Bootstrap that I missed, however, was the nav bar. With that in mind, I set out to make one of my own and ended up with Nabbar Nav.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Because Nabbar is a React Component, it is expected that you have a React site ready for it. If you are starting from scratch, I recommend using [Facebook's own create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and have included a boilerplate example in [example-create-react-app](example-create-react-app).


### Installing

#### Manual Installation 

First, clone the project to a local directory.

```
   git clone https://github.com/regexpressyourself/Nabbar-Nav.git && cd Nabbar-Nav
```

Then simply include the Nabbar component as shown below.

#### Using NPM

An NPM version of Nabbar Nav is currently in the works. If you are interested in helping publish Nabbar Nav, see [contributing](#contributing).

## Deployment

You will need to include the Nabbar Nav component somewhere in your React project to use it. All Nabbar components and stylesheets expect to be placed in the same directory. 

Once you have Nabbar Nav included in your project, you should make sure that the surrounding component hierarchy is in place:


### Component Hierarchy

There is a specific way to set up your component hierarchy if you want to start using Nabbar out of the box. In addition the Nabbar component, you will need at least two others: a main wrapper which will call Nabbar, and a body element which will hold the body of your site.

The selectors for each of these elements are defined in Nabbar.css, but by default, the wrapper is expected to have an attribute of:

```
className="App" 
```

and the body should have an attribute of:

```
   className="Body"
```

A mockup of the top-level component's render method is as follows:

``` js
render() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Nabbar />
      <div className="Body">
        Body content/component goes here.
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Defining Menu Items

Menu Items in your navigation can be defined in the NabbarMenu component. All menu items are stored in NabbarMenu's state as objects in an array. 

Menu Items can either call a component function, or link to a route, depending on how you define your menu item objects.

The menu item object is laid out as follows:

```
   {
      // title is required
      title: Title Of Menu Item, 

      // href should only be declared if the menu item is a link
      href: The link the the menu item points to,

      // onClick should only be declared if the menu item calls a function
      onClick: The function to be called when clicking the menu item
   }
```

## Built With

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - The web framework that powers the site
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - A module builder automate development and production build processes
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Transpiler to convert raw React code into browser-ready HTML and Javascript
* [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - CSS Grid was the inspiration for this project, and is actually amazingly fun to work with
